Greetings!
<br>
<br>Cedar Hill, Texas is home to Bridges Safehouse and Hope Mansion. &nbsp;These two faith-based organizations provide safe shelter and loving environments to help pregnant and homeless women and their children who are in crisis. &nbsp;Exciting plans are now being developed that will unify and strengthen both of these important community-supported ministries.

**Background Information**

Bridges Safehouse is a shelter for homeless women, and women in crisis along with their young children. &nbsp;Each year Bridges serves 60-75 women and children through a 30-day program providing shelter, resources, life-skills, and mentoring while showing them the love and grace available through Jesus Christ.
